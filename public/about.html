<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science Engineering graduate with a strong passion for building intuitive and user-friendly web applications. 
During my academic journey, I developed a solid foundation in programming, data structures, and software development principles,
which sparked my interest in creating seamless digital experiences.</p>

<p>Web development quickly became my area of focus, where I enjoy combining creative design with functional coding. I have 
experience working with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, as well as back-end tools such as Node.js
and MongoDB. I take pride in writing clean, efficient code and continuously seek to improve my skills by building personal 
projects and contributing to open-source.</p>

<p>I am eager to join a collaborative team where I can grow as a web developer and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects.
I thrive in dynamic environments that encourage innovation, learning, and problem-solving, and I'm excited about the opportunity
to shape the digital future through thoughtful design and development.</p>
